      "1paragraph": "The Kanban method increases the efficiency of business processes and shortens the time of delivering a product or service to the customer by constantly improving, optimizing, and streamlining the system. All this to achieve the most excellent fluency in the execution of work.",
      "2paragraph": "Taking small steps while working helps prioritize better. Most tasks seem urgent when in bulk, when broken down into pieces - you clearly see what needs to be done first. It is helpful to make tasks manageable, just by limiting the amount of work in progress to one or two tasks per person. This way it's also much more clear who is doing what.",
      "3paragraph": "After the work is done, you can analyze the workflow by use of Kanban charts and analytics. Kanban Tool's Time Tracking feature leaves no room for guesstimating how long it took to complete the task."
